PyQtGraph: A pure-Python graphics library. PyQtGraph is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / engineering applications. Despite being written entirely in python, the library is fast due to its heavy leverage of numpy for number crunching, Qt's GraphicsView framework for 2D display, and OpenGL for 3D display.
